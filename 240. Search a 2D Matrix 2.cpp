/*

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
Example:

Consider the following matrix:

[
  [1,   4,  7, 11, 15],
  [2,   5,  8, 12, 19],
  [3,   6,  9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
]
Given target = 5, return true.

Given target = 20, return false.

class Solution {
public:
    bool searchMatrix(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int target) {
    int m = matrix.size();
    if (m == 0) return false;
    int n = matrix[0].size();

    int i = 0, j = n - 1;
    while (i < m && j >= 0) {
        if (matrix[i][j] == target)
            return true;
        else if (matrix[i][j] > target) {
            j--;
        } else 
            i++;
